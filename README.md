TECHSAKSHAM | CAPSTONE PROJECT | EDUNET FOUNDATION | BATCH NO - 06

## Use of this project
The project aims to make help keep a track of money inflow and outflow. Many people in India live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the end of the month they donâ€™t have sufficient money to meet their needs. While this problem can arise due to low income, invariably it is due to poor money management skills. People tend to overspend without realizing, which can prove to be disastrous. Using a daily expense manager can help them keep track of how much they spend every day and on what. Using an expense tracker is one of the best ways to get their expenses under control and bring some semblance of order to their finances.
# Expense Tracker
Keep a track of your own income and expenses and have a clear picture of where your money is going.
In-view of Techsaksham project, we have designed a website to help the needy. We used HTML, CSS for the front-end and PHP for the back-end. We also used XAMPP server as our Local Host.
